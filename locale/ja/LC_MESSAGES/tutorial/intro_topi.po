"Let's revisit the sum of rows operation (equivalent to :code:`B = "

"However, for such a common operation we had to define the reduce axis "

":code:`topi.sum` much like :code:`numpy.sum`"

"Up to now, we have seen an example of how TOPI can save us from writing "

" we did the scheduling as before. TOPI also provides higher level "
