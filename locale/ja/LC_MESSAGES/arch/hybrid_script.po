"Correct me if I am wrong: I believe that how 1. is implemented is "
"dangerous, but I have no choice. What I did is to add those names into "
"python dict ``func.__global__`` and after the call to ``func`` is done, "
"those names will be cleaned up."

"Compilation is a large module, you can see ``python/tvm/te/hybrid/`` for "

"Unlike what that is in HalideIR, in ``loop_type(a, b)``, ``a`` is the "

"``loop_type(a, b)`` indicates ``[a, b)``. Thus, when lowering it to "
