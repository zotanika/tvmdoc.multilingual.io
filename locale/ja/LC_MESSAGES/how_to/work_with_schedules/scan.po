"The scan is carried over the highest dimension of the tensor. "
":code:`s_state` is a placeholder that describes the transition state of "
"the scan. :code:`s_init` describes how we can initialize the first k "
"timesteps. Here since s_init's first dimension is 1, it describes how we "
"initialize The state at first timestep."

":code:`s_update` describes how to update the value at timestep t. The "

" current or later timestep."
