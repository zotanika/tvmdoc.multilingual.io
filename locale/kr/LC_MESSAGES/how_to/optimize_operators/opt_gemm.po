"(TL;DR) TVM provides abstract interfaces which allows users to depict an "
"algorithm and the algorithm's implementing organization (the so-called "
"schedule) separately. Typically, writing algorithm in high-performance "
"schedule breaks the algorithm's readability and modularity. Also, trying "
"various seemingly promising schedules is time-consuming. With the help of"
" TVM, we can try these schedules efficiently to enhance the performance."
