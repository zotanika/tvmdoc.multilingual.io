"To auto-tune a neural network, we partition the network into small "
"subgraphs and tune them independently. Each subgraph is treated as one "
"search task. A task scheduler slices the time and dynamically allocates "
"time resources to these tasks. The task scheduler predicts the impact of "
"each task on the end-to-end execution time and prioritizes the one that "
"can reduce the execution time the most."

"For each subgraph, we use the compute declaration in "
