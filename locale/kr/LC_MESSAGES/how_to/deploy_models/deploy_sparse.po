"This tutorial demonstrates how to take any pruned model, in this case "
"`PruneBert from Hugging Face <https://huggingface.co/huggingface"
"/prunebert-base-uncased-6-finepruned-w-distil-squad>`_, and use TVM to "
"leverage the model's sparsity support to produce real speedups. Although "
"the primary purpose of this tutorial is to realize speedups on already "
"pruned models, it may also be useful to estimate how fast a model would "
"be *if* it were pruned. To this end, we also provide a function that "
"takes an unpruned model and replaces its weights with random and pruned "
"weights at a specified sparsity. This may be a useful feature when trying"
" to decide if a model is worth pruning or not."

"Pruning is a technique primarily used to reduce the parameter size of a "
"model by replacing weight values with 0s. Although many methods exist for"
" choosing which weights should be set to 0, the most straight forward is "
"by picking the weights with the smallest value. Typically, weights are "
"pruned to a desired sparsity percentage. For example, a 95% sparse model "
"would have only 5% of its weights non-zero. Pruning to very high "
"sparsities often requires finetuning or full retraining as it tends to be"
" a lossy approximation. Although parameter size benefits are quite easy "
"to obtain from a pruned model through simple compression, leveraging "
"sparsity to yield runtime speedups is more complicated."

"In structured sparsity weights are pruned with the goal of clustering "
"pruned weights together. In other words, they are pruned using both their"
" value and location. The benefit of bunching up pruned weights is that it"
" allows an algorithm such as matrix multiplication to skip entire blocks."
" It turns out that some degree of *block sparsity* is very important to "
"realizing significant speedups on most hardware available today. This is "
"because when loading memory in most CPUs or GPUs, it doesn't save any "
"work to skip reading a single value at a time, instead an entire chunk or"
" tile is read in and executed using something like vectorized "
"instructions."

"Unstructured sparse weights are those that are pruned only on the value "
"of the original weights. They may appear to be scattered randomly "
"throughout a tensor rather than in chunks like we'd see in block sparse "
"weights. At low sparsities, unstructured pruning techniques are difficult"
" to accelerate. However, at high sparsities many blocks of all 0 values "
"will naturally appear, making it possible to accelerate."

"This tutorial interacts with both structured and unstructured sparsity. "
"Hugging Face's PruneBert model is unstructured but 95% sparse, allowing "
"us to apply TVM's block sparse optimizations to it, even if not "
"optimally. When generating random sparse weights for an unpruned model, "
"we do so with structured sparsity. A fun exercise is comparing the real "
"speed of PruneBert with the block sparse speed using fake weights to see "
"the benefit of structured sparsity."
