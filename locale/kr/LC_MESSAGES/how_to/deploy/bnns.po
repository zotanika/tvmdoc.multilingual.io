"Apple BNNS library is a collection of functions that can be used to "
"construct neural networks for inference (and train). Itâ€™s supported in "
"macOS, iOS, tvOS, and watchOS. BNNS provides primitives executed on all "
"CPU supported on those platforms and optimized for high performance and "
"low-energy consumption. This integration will offload as many operators "
"as possible from Relay to BNNS."

"\"freeze_params=True\" or performer binding manually. In general cases "
"all relay importers don't do that by default. For your convenience "

"To use BNNS integration for models with interleave input layout, they "

" layout conversion will happen only for explicitly enumerated types of "
"ops. It might happen that depending on topology there might be regular "
"data reorder around conv2d to interleave and planar layout. This will be "
