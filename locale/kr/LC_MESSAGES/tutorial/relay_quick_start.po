":py:func:`relay.build` returns three components: the execution graph in "
"json format, the TVM module library of compiled functions specifically "

"We'll first compile for Nvidia GPU. Behind the scene, "
":py:func:`relay.build` first does a number of graph-level optimizations, "
"e.g. pruning, fusing, etc., then registers the operators (i.e. the nodes "
"of the optimized graphs) to TVM implementations to generate a "
"`tvm.module`. To generate the module library, TVM will first transfer the"
" high level IR into the lower intrinsic IR of the specified target "
"backend, which is CUDA in this example. Then the machine code will be "
"generated as the module library."
