"Inline assembly is compiler-specific. While Clang and GCC have "

" and linked against the operator."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_staging/arch/microtvm_design.rst:173
msgid ""
"At present, microTVM presumes that all eligible schedules can be "
"compiled. This means that the user- supplied project (see next section) "
"must include all libraries that are used by the generated code. When not "
"using autotuning, TVM randomly chooses a fallback schedule, so all "
"libraries would need to be supported. When using autotuning, TVM selects "
"the best-performing schedule, so only that library is needed. There isn't"

"autotuning logs, but that would be a good addition."

"Finally, when using the ``llvm`` backend, the process is similar except "
"that LLVM bitcode is included in the generated code (with an "
"``import_llvm`` pragma). LLVM bitcode provides a portable way to call "
"inline assembly. However, it may be more complex to call external C "
