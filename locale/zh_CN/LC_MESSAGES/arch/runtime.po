"`PackedFunc`_ is a simple but elegant solution we find to solve the "

"In the above codeblock, we defined a PackedFunc MyAdd. It takes two "
"arguments : ``args`` represents input arguments and ``rv`` represents "
"return value. The function is type-erased, which means that the function "
"signature does not restrict which input type to pass in or type to "
"return. Under the hood, when we call a PackedFunc, it packs the input "
"arguments to TVMArgs on stack, and gets the result back via TVMRetValue."

"Thanks to template tricks in C++, we can call a PackedFunc just like a "

"The restriction makes the implementation simple without the need of "

"TVM provides a `minimum C API`_, which allows us to embed the PackedFunc "

"To keep the runtime minimum, we isolated the IR Object support from the "

msgstr ""

#: ../../_staging/arch/runtime.rst:149
msgid ""
"The overhead of calling into PackedFunc vs. a normal function is small, "
"as it is only saving a few values on the stack. So it is OK as long as we"
" don't wrap small functions. In summary, the PackedFunc is the universal "
"glue in TVM where we use it extensively to support our compiler and "
"deployment."

msgid ""
"Since TVM supports multiple types of devices, we need to support "
"different type of drivers. We have to use the driver API to load the "
"kernel, set up the argument in packed format and perform kernel launch. "
"We also need to patch up the driver API so that the exposed functions are"
" threadsafe. So we often need to implement these driver glues in C++ and "
"expose them to the user. We can certainly not do it for each type of "
"functions, so again PackedFunc is our answer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../_staging/arch/runtime.rst:164

"TVM defines the compiled object as `Module`_. The user can get the "
"compiled function from Module as PackedFunc. The generated compiled code "
"can dynamically get function from Module in runtime. It caches the "
"function handle in the first call and reuses in subsequent calls. We use "
"this to link device code and callback into any PackedFunc(e.g., python) "
"from generated code."

"The ModuleNode is an abstract class that can be implemented by each type "

"The PackedFunc and Module system also makes it easy to ship the function "

"The RPC server itself is minimum and can be bundled into the runtime. We "

msgid ""
"We introduced a base class, called `Object`_ to solve this problem. All "
"the language object in the compiler stack is a subclass of ``Object``. "
"Each object contains a string type_key that uniquely identifies the type "
"of object. We choose string instead of int as type key so new ``Object`` "
"class can be added in the decentralized fashion without adding the code "
"back to the central repo. To ease the speed of dispatching, we allocate "
"an integer type_index at runtime for each type_key."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Since usually one ``Object`` could be referenced in multiple places in "
"the language, we use a shared_ptr to keep track of reference. We use "
"``ObjectRef`` class to represent a reference to the ``Object``. We can "
"roughly view ``ObjectRef`` class as shared_ptr to the ``Object`` "
"container. We can also define subclass ``ObjectRef`` to hold each "
"subtypes of ``Object``. Each subclass of ``Object`` needs to define the "
"VisitAttr function."

"In the above examples, both ``Operation`` and ``Array<Expr>`` are "
"ObjectRef. The VisitAttrs gives us a reflection API to visit each member "
"of the object. We can use this function to visit the node and serialize "
"any language object recursively. It also allows us to get members of an "
"object easily in front-end language. For example, in the following code, "
"we accessed the op field of the TensorNode."
msgstr ""

"New ``Object`` can be added to C++ without changing the front-end "

"that this is not the fastest way to expose members to front-end language,"
" but might be one of the simplest approaches possible. We also find that "
"it fits our purposes as we mainly use python for testing and prototyping "
"and still use c++ to do the heavy lifting job."
