"In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to write a high performance "
"convolution implementation in TVM. We use square size input tensors and "
"filters as an example, and assume the input to convolution has a large "
"batch. In this example, we use a different layout to store the data in "
"order to achieve better data locality. The buffer layout is HWCN, which "
"stands for height, width, channel, batch."

"We use the fixed size for input tensors with 256 channels and 14 x 14 "
"dimensions. The batch size is 256. Convolution filters contain 512 "
"filters of size 3 x 3.  We use stride size 1 and padding size 1 for the "
"convolution. The following code defines the convolution algorithm in TVM."

"We first specify the memory hierarchy for buffers. The figure below shows"
" the GPU memory hierarchy. One important difference from CPU memory "
"hierarchy is that GPU provides a cache buffer called shared memory, which"
" is managed by programmers. Thus how to maximize the data reuse in the "
"shared memory is critical to achieve high performance in GPU kernels."

"In this example, we load both Apad and W into buffer AA and WW, which are"
" stored in the shared memory. These bufferes will be later shared by all "
"threads within the same thread block to compute the convolution. Each "
"thread then loads its own part from shared buffer into their local "
"registers, AL and WL. BL is a local cache of output B, which is also "
"stored in the thread local registers."

"The following code splits the workload into thread blocks and individual "

"in the figure below, given a pixel coordinate (y, x), a thread block is "
"responsible for computing a region of block_factor x block_factor (64 x "
"64) for output channels and batch. Due to the limit of shared memory "
"space, we only load step x block_factor (8 x 64) data from Apad and B "

"We further split the workload from a thread block to individual threads. "
"To avoid *memory bank conflict*, we use virtual thread to split the area "
"into 4 parts, and then tile into 8x8 grids. Therefore, shown in the "
"figure below, each thread computes 4 strided grids, where size of each "
"grid is 4 x 4."
