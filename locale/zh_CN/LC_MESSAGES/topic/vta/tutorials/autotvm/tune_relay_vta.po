"The operator implementation for VTA in TVM is written in template form. "
"The template has many tunable knobs (tile factor, virtual threads, etc). "
"We will tune all convolution operators in the neural network. After "
"tuning, we produce a log file which stores the best schedule parameters "
"for all tuned operators. When the TVM compiler compiles these operators, "
"it will query this log file to get the best knob parameters."
