"This article is an introductory tutorial to build a Graph Convolutional "
"Network (GCN) with Relay. In this tutorial, we will run our GCN on Cora "
"dataset to demonstrate. Cora dataset is a common benchmark for Graph "
"Neural Networks (GNN) and frameworks that support GNN training and "
"inference. We directly load the dataset from DGL library to do the apples"
