"While TVM supports transparent code generation, sometimes it is also "
"helpful to incorporate manual written code into the pipeline. For "
"example, we might want to use cuDNN for some of the convolution kernels "
"and define the rest of the stages."

"TVM supports these black box function calls natively. Specfically, TVM "
"support all the tensor functions that are DLPack compatible. Which means "
"we can call any function with POD types(pointer, int, float) or pointer "
"to DLTensor as argument."

"In the example below, we use :any:`te.extern` to add an extern array "
"function call. In the extern call, we declare the shape of output "
"tensors. In the second argument we provide the list of inputs."

"User will need to provide a function describing how to compute the "

"In this case we simply call a registered TVM function, which invokes a "
"CBLAS call. TVM does not control internal of the extern array function "
"and treats it as blackbox. We can further mix schedulable TVM calls that "
"add a bias term to the result."

"The following example registers a python function into TVM runtime system"
