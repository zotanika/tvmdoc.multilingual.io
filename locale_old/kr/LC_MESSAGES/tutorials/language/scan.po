"TVM supports a scan operator to describe symbolic loop. The following "
"scan op computes cumsum over columns of X."

"The scan is carried over the highest dimension of the tensor. "
":code:`s_state` is a placeholder that describes the transition state of "
"the scan. :code:`s_init` describes how we can initialize the first k "
"timesteps. Here since s_init's first dimension is 1, it describes how we "
"initialize The state at first timestep."

":code:`s_update` describes how to update the value at timestep t. The "
"update value can refer back to the values of previous timestep via state "
"placeholder. Note that while it is invalid to refer to :code:`s_state` at"
" current or later timestep."

"The scan takes in state placeholder, initial value and update "
"description. It is also recommended(although not necessary) to list the "

"We can schedule the body of the scan by scheduling the update and init "
