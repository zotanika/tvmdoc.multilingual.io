"This tutorial provides an end-to-end demo, on how to run ImageNet "
"classification inference onto the VTA accelerator design to perform "
"ImageNet classification tasks. It showcases Relay as a front end compiler"
" that can perform quantization (VTA only supports int8/32 inference) as "
"well as graph packing (in order to enable tensorization in the core) to "
"massage the compute graph for the hardware target."
