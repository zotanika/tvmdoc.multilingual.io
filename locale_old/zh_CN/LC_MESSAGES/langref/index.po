"Relay is a functional, differentiable programming language designed to be"
" an expressive intermediate representation for machine learning systems. "
"Relay supports algebraic data types, closures, control flow, and "
"recursion, allowing it to directly represent more complex models than "
"computation graph-based IRs can. Relay also includes a form of dependent "
"typing using *type relations* in order to handle shape analysis for "
"operators with complex requirements on argument shapes."
