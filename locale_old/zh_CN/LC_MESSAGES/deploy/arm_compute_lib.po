"Arm Compute Library (ACL) is an open source project that provides "
"accelerated kernels for Arm CPU's and GPU's. Currently the integration "
"offloads operators to ACL to use hand-crafted assembler routines in the "
"library. By offloading select operators from a relay graph to ACL we can "
"achieve a performance boost on such devices."

"Before installing Arm Compute Library, it is important to know what "
"architecture to build for. One way to determine this is to use `lscpu` "
"and look for the \"Model name\" of the CPU. You can then use this to "
"determine the architecture by looking online."

"Use the script located at "

"script for building ACL from source natively or for cross-compiling the "
"library on an x86 machine. You may need to change the architecture of the"
" device you wish to compile for by altering the `target_arch` variable. "
"Binaries will be built from source and installed to the location denoted "

"Alternatively, you can download and use pre-built binaries from: "

"In both cases you will need to set USE_ARM_COMPUTE_LIB_GRAPH_RUNTIME to "
