"The operator implementation for ARM CPU in TVM is written in template "
"form. The template has many tunable knobs (tile factor, vectorization, "
"unrolling, etc). We will tune all convolution and depthwise convolution "
"operators in the neural network. After tuning, we produce a log file "
"which stores the best knob values for all required operators. When the "
"TVM compiler compiles these operators, it will query this log file to get"
" the best knob values."
