"Relay uses TVM internally to generate target specific code. For example, "
"with cuda backend TVM generates cuda kernels for all layers in the user "
"provided network. But sometimes it is also helpful to incorporate "
"external libraries developed by various vendors into Relay. Luckily, TVM "
"has a mechanism to transparently call into these libraries. For Relay "
"users, all we need to do is just to set a target string appropriately."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/frontend/using_external_lib.rst:32
msgid ""
"Before we can use external libraries from Relay, your TVM needs to be "
"built with libraries you want to use. For example, to use cuDNN, "
"USE_CUDNN option in `cmake/config.cmake` needs to be enabled, and cuDNN "
"include and library directories need to be specified if necessary."

"The generated pseudo code should look something like below. Note how bias"
" add, batch normalization, and ReLU activation are fused into the "

"We can use cuDNN to replace convolution kernels with cuDNN ones. To do "
"that, all we need to do is to append the option \" -libs=cudnn\" to the "
"target string."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/frontend/using_external_lib.rst:587
msgid ""
"Note that if you use cuDNN, Relay cannot fuse convolution with layers "
"following it. This is because layer fusion happens at the level of TVM "
"internal representation(IR). Relay treats external libraries as black "
"box, so there is no way to fuse them with TVM IR."

"The pseudo code below shows that cuDNN convolution + bias add + batch "

msgid ""
"This tutorial covered the usage of cuDNN with Relay. We also have support"
" for cuBLAS. If cuBLAS is enabled, it will be used inside a fully "
"connected layer (relay.dense). To use cuBLAS, set a target string as "
"\"cuda -libs=cublas\". You can use both cuDNN and cuBLAS with \"cuda "
"-libs=cudnn,cublas\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/frontend/using_external_lib.rst:634
msgid ""
"For ROCm backend, we have support for MIOpen and rocBLAS. They can be "
"enabled with target \"rocm -libs=miopen,rocblas\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/frontend/using_external_lib.rst:637
msgid ""
"Being able to use external libraries is great, but we need to keep in "
"mind some cautions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/frontend/using_external_lib.rst:639
msgid ""
"First, the use of external libraries may restrict your usage of TVM and "
"Relay. For example, MIOpen only supports NCHW layout and fp32 data type "
"at the moment, so you cannot use other layouts or data type in TVM."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/frontend/using_external_lib.rst:642
msgid ""
"Second, and more importantly, external libraries restrict the possibility"
" of operator fusion during graph compilation, as shown above. TVM and "
"Relay aim to achieve the best performance on a variety of hardwares, with"
" joint operator level and graph level optimization. To achieve this goal,"
" we should continue developing better optimizations for TVM and Relay, "
"while using external libraries as a nice way to fall back to existing "
"implementation when necessary."
