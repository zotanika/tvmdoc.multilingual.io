"As the number of hardware devices targeted by deep learning workloads "
"keeps increasing, the required knowledge for users to achieve high "
"performance on various devices keeps increasing as well. To free data "
"scientists from worrying about the performance when developing a new "
"model, hardware backend providers either provide libraries such as MKLDNN"
" or cuDNN with many commonly used deep learning operators, or provide "
"frameworks such as TensorRT to let users describe their models in a "
"certain way to achieve high performance. However, users have to learn a "
"new programming interface when they attempt to work on a new library or "
"device. As a result, the demand for a unified programming interface "
"becomes more and more important to 1) let all users and hardware backend "
"providers stand on the same page, and 2) provide a feasible solution to "
"allow specialized hardware or library to only support widely used "
