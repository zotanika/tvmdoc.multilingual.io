"We briefly introduced types while detailing Relay's expression language, "
"but have not yet described its type system. Relay is a statically typed "
"and type-inferred language, allowing programs to be fully typed while "
"requiring just a few explicit type annotations."

"Static types are useful when performing compiler optimizations because "
"they communicate properties about the data a program manipulates, such as"
" runtime shape, data layout, and storage, without needing to run the "
"program. Relay's `Algebraic Data Types`_ allow for easily and flexibly "
"composing types in order to build data structures that can be reasoned "
"about inductively and used to write recursive functions."

"Relay's type system features a form of *dependent typing* for shapes. "
"That is, its type system keeps track of the shapes of tensors in a Relay "
"program. Treating tensor shapes as types allows Relay to perform more "
"powerful reasoning at compile time; in particular, Relay can statically "
"reason about operations whose output shapes vary based on the input "
"shapes in complex ways. Casting shape inference as a type inference "
"problem allows Relay to infer the shapes of all tensors at compile time, "
"including in programs that use branching and function calls."
msgstr ""

#: ../../langref/relay_type.rst:41
msgid ""
"Statically reasoning about shapes in this manner allows Relay to be "
"ahead-of-time compiled and provides much more information about tensors "
"for optimizations further in the compilation pipeline. Such optimizations"
" can be implemented as passes, which are Relay-to-Relay AST "
"transformations, and may use the inferred types (e.g., shape information)"
" for making decisions about program transformations. For instance, "
":code:`src/relay/pass/fuse_ops.cc` gives an implementation of a pass that"
" uses inferred tensor shapes to replace invocations of operators in a "
"Relay program with fused operator implementations."

"Reasoning about tensor types in Relay is encoded using *type relations*, "
"which means that the bulk of type checking in Relay is constraint solving"
" (ensuring that all type relations are satisfied at call sites). Type "
"relations offer a flexible and relatively simple way of making the power "
"of dependent typing available in Relay without greatly increasing the "
"complexity of its type system."
